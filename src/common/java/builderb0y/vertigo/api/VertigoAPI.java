	returns true if the packet containing the blocks for the provided

	@apiNote minecraft will delay some chunks to prevent timeouts since 1.21.

	it is not guaranteed to be loaded on the client yet.

	also, vertigo's unload distance is one section bigger than its load distance.
	as such, even if the section is outside the range of the player,
	it is not guaranteed to be unloaded yet either.

	if this method is called on the logical client with the main client player entity,

	blocks for the provided section has been received and processed.

	if this method is called on the logical client with a different player
	(for example, another player in multiplayer), then this method returns false.

	this method is NOT thread-safe, and should ONLY be called from the render thread or the server thread.
